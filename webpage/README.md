# Mobile Gallery




 

INTRODUCTION

The Mobile Gallery project aims to provide an easy-to-navigate and comprehensive mobile device repository, where users can access detailed information about various mobile devices, including specifications, images, and user reviews. This project comes in response to the need for a reliable resource to compare and select the ideal mobile device that suits individual preferences and requirements.

The Mobile Gallery project is a web application that allows users to view and browse information about various mobile phones. The key features of the project include:

	User authentication - Users can register and login to access the application.

	Browse mobiles - Logged in users can view and browse mobile phones, see details like price, specs etc.

	Admin features - Admin users can add, edit and manage mobile phone data in the system.

The project is implemented using:

	Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
	Backend: PHP
	Database: MySQL

The application has a home page, about and contact pages accessible to all visitors. To access mobile data, users need to register and login.

Once logged in, users can browse and view all mobiles, sorted by price in ascending order. They can click on 'Details' to see full specifications of a mobile.

The admin section allows adding and editing mobiles after logging in as an admin user. Admins can also add new brands that are then available when adding a new mobile.

Database Design

The MySQL database has the following tables:

	Users - To store registered user information
	Admins - For admin user data
	Mobiles - Contains mobile phone data like price, specs etc.
	Brands - Contains phone brands and logo image

Foreign keys are used to link mobiles to brands.

Technologies Used:

The Mobile Gallery project leverages a range of technologies to ensure a robust and user-friendly platform. Below is an overview of the key technologies used in this project:

•	PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor): PHP serves as the core programming language for the Mobile Gallery project. It allows us to create dynamic web pages and interact with databases, making it a suitable choice for building web applications that rely on server-side scripting.

•	MySQL Database: To manage the extensive catalog of mobile devices, we use the MySQL database management system. It helps us store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently, ensuring fast and reliable access to device information.

•	HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): HTML and CSS are fundamental web technologies used to structure and style the content of the Mobile Gallery. HTML defines the layout and content, while CSS controls the visual presentation, ensuring a clean and visually appealing user interface.

•	JavaScript: JavaScript is utilized for adding interactivity to the Mobile Gallery website. It enables features like user reviews, search functionality, and dynamic page elements, enhancing the user experience.

•	Bootstrap Framework: Bootstrap is a front-end framework that aids in designing responsive and mobile-friendly web pages. It ensures that the Mobile Gallery website looks and functions seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.

•	Version Control (e.g., Git): To manage codebase changes and collaborate effectively, version control systems like Git are employed.

The combination of these technologies provides the foundation for the Mobile Gallery project, allowing users to seamlessly explore and compare mobile devices while enjoying a responsive and user-friendly web experience.
